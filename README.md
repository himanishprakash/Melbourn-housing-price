# Melbourne Housing Price Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to analyze and predict housing prices in Melbourne using various machine learning models. The objective is to understand the factors affecting housing prices and to build a reliable predictive model.

## Business Problem

The real estate market is dynamic and influenced by numerous factors, including location, property type, and size. Accurate prediction of housing prices is crucial for both buyers and sellers to make informed decisions. This project seeks to address the challenge of predicting Melbourne housing prices by employing data-driven approaches, thus aiding stakeholders in the real estate market.

## Data

The dataset includes various features such as location, number of rooms, type of property, method of sale, and others. Specific details about the dataset used for analysis and modeling are described within the notebook.

## Methodology

The analysis involves several key steps:
- Data Exploration: Understanding the dataset through visualization and statistical analysis.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
- Model Building: Implementing different models to predict housing prices.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of models using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), R-square, and IC (Information Criteria).

## Results

The results section outlines the performance of different models, including Linear Regression and Lasso Regression, based on various metrics such as RMSE, R-square, AIC (Akaike Information Criterion), BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), and cross-validation scores.

## Conclusions

Insights derived from model evaluations are summarized, highlighting the effectiveness of the models in predicting housing prices and their implications for the real estate market.
