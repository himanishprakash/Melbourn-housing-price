## Melbourne Housing Price Analysis

This Jupyter Notebook presents a comprehensive analysis of housing prices in Melbourne. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing steps, model training, and evaluation to understand the dynamics affecting Melbourne's housing market. The notebook is structured as follows:

### Sections:

1. **EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis):** Initial exploration of the dataset to uncover insights and patterns.

2. **Data Preprocess Steps:** Preparation and cleaning of the data for modeling.

3. **Linear Regression:** Building and training a linear regression model to predict housing prices.

4. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluation of the linear regression model's performance on the training and test data.

5. **Lasso Regression:** Introduction of Lasso regression for modeling and its evaluation.

6. **Out of Sample Performance:** Analysis of the models' performance on unseen data, including cross-fold validation and interpretation of Information Criteria statistics (ICs).

7. **Insights and Observations:** Key findings from the analysis, including the impact of the number of rooms and the year a house was built on its price, regional price variations, and the collinearity between features.
